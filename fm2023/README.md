## Installation and Setup

### Cloning the Repository

1.  **Install Git**: Ensure Git is installed on your system. If not, download and install from [Git's official site](https://git-scm.com/).
2.  **Clone the Repository**: Open a terminal/command prompt and run the following command:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/HarrisonRClark/fm_client_app` 
    


### Setting Up the Development Environment
For me personally, this is my dev environment:
1.  **Install Visual Studio Code**: If not already installed, download and install VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2.  **Install Live Server Extension**:
    -   Open VS Code.
    -   Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
    -   Search for "Live Server" and install the extension by Ritwick Dey.

### Running the Application

1.  **Open the Project in VS Code**: Open the cloned FM Client App folder in Visual Studio Code.
2.  **Start Live Server**:
    -   Right-click on `index.html`.
    -   Select `Open with Live Server`.
    -   This will launch the FM Client App in your default web browser and enable hot reloading.
